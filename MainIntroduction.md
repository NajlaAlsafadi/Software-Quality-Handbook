# Introduction 

Welcome to the **Handbook of MNA Solutions**. Our company is a fast-moving software engineering team. It's very important to establish a consistent approach to our work to ensure predictable progress with projects and lessen defects in production. 

This handbook aims to unify our approach by providing clear guidelines in *Task Estimation in Scrum*, *code reviews*, and *CI/CD* (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment). 

The purpose of this handbook is to serve as a comprehensive guide for both existing and new team members, outlining the right way to approach key aspects of our work. We aim to enhance collaborations, deliver high-quality products to consumers, and increase efficiency by following these best practices.
