# Software-Quality-Handbook
Create a company handbook on Software Quality

You work for a small, fast moving startup with 20 software engineers. Up to now each engineer on the team has been doing things their own way. Unfortunately this has resulted in very unpredictable progress with projects and a lot of defects making it into production.
Your small team has been asked to research and write a handbook of best practices. Existing and new members of the team will read this to learn what is the "right way" to do things in this company.

The handbook should cover the following topics:

•	Task estimation in Scrum

•	Code reviews

•	And one other topic of your choosing, based on your own research

Handbook content:

Find 5 good quality resources (articles, blog posts etc) related to each topic and identify common themes among them. You should prioritize resources that talk about personal experiences of the topic, rather than academic articles that just talk about the theory. For example in Task Estimation its more interesting to read about the challenges of accurately estimating tasks rather than finding articles that just describe what "planning poker" is.

Your handbook should have an introduction that explains the purpose as well as the structure of the document. It will have a section for each topic that introduces the topic briefly and then summarizes the most important guidelines in bullet points / diagrams. Note that it's just as important to highlight bad practices to avoid as good practices to follow. Each section should also contain links to the reference articles for further reading. 
This is not an essay-style handbook - the goal is to make it easy for team members to skim read. Aim for 500 - 1000 words per topic. Pictures/diagrams are excellent for conveying a lot of information quickly.

Process:

Your handbook will take the form of a public repository on Github. Use Markdown to style the content, embed images, links etc. Note that VS Code has a built in Markdown preview that you'll find useful.

The first thing you should add to your repository is a project plan: what are the different tasks that you need to do to complete the project, what order do they need to happen in and who is going to work on each one. At least two members of the team must contribute to each of the topics.

Follow the Gitflow process you practiced in the week 6 lab. Each task that you work on should have a feature branch, be merged into the develop branch following a pull request, etc. All team members must commit content to the repository and be involved in giving feedback on pull requests.

Finally, when the tasks are finished identify a list of things you would do differently as a team the next time. Add this list to the repository below the project plan you created.
