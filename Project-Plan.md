## Retrospective
### How it went?
- Begining seemed more complex but we broke it down into smaller task.
- Worked on everything step by step.
- Met up regulary and had catch-ups in order to help each other out and keep on top of our tasks.
- Using git became easier after a few PRs.
- We made sure to approve each others PRs and give feedback if necessary.
- It was good having some deadlines for finishing our work as it made it more convenient when two people were working on the same topic.

### What we would do different next time?
- Double check which branch we are merging into. We made a mistake at the start where we didn't check before merging into develop and accidentally merged into main.

- Also would have been good to come up with unique image naming convention at the start as we encountered a conflicting name when merging and had to fix it.
