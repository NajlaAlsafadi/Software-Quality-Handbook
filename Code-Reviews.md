# Code Reviews

**What is Code Review:**

Peer Code Review, also known as Code Review, involves programmers collaborating to review each other's code for errors. This practice has been proven to streamline and expedite software development more than any other technique. It is an essential component of the software development lifecycle and typically occurs before merging code changes into the primary codebase. Code reviews can be performed manually or with the assistance of automated tools. Although numerous tools and software are available, comprehending the fundamental concept is critical. Software is created by humans and is susceptible to human errors. While software developers frequently rely on manuals and automated testing to verify code, it is still imperative to utilize human abilities to identify and rectify mistakes.

## Types of Code Reviews

- **INSTANT REVIEW**: This is done in pair programming and works well when two developers with similar skill sets are working on a complex business problem. It is usually performed when deadlines are tight.

- **SYNCHRONOUS REVIEW**: Particularly effective when the reviewer requires an explanation from the coder due to limited knowledge of the task's objective. This approach is commonly employed when time is of the essence, such as when addressing high-priority bug fixes or implementing urgent changes.

- **ASYNCHRONOUS REVIEW**: Used when team members are spread across the globe or have conflicting meeting schedules. These are used to prevent the problem of forced context switching and work well for the most common use cases.

- **TEAM REVIEWS**: Involve a group of developers or peers who collaborate to provide feedback on each other's code changes before integration. They allow for in-depth analysis of the code from multiple perspectives, increasing the chances of identifying defects. Additionally, they provide a valuable opportunity for knowledge sharing and collaboration.
