**What is Code Review:**

Peer Code Review, also known as Code Review, involves programmers collaborating to review each other's code for errors. This practice has been proven to streamline and expedite software development more than any other technique. It is an essential component of the software development lifecycle and typically occurs before merging code changes into the primary codebase. Code reviews can be performed manually or with the assistance of automated tools. Although numerous tools and software are available, comprehending the fundamental concept is critical. Software is created by humans and is susceptible to human errors. While software developers frequently rely on manuals and automated testing to verify code, it is still imperative to utilize human abilities to identify and rectify mistakes.
